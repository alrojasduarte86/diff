## Requirements

- Make sure the PC you will be running the application on has the JDK 1.8 installed
- Make sure that the PC you will be running the application has internet access, so that when the application is run all of the dependencies can be downloaded properly
- If you open the app on an IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ) install the lombok
plugin as the application uses this framework to remove boilerplate code. Further instructions can be found at:
